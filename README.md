# edtech-resources

Hi! I love ed tech and other applications of technology to social good.

I also love lists, so I made a table of over 50 companies in edtech and social good I've found over the past few years!

I also have a table of groups/meetups/events in education technology.

Please feel free to add more resources! I look forward to seeing your pull request :) -- and if you're unfamiliar with 
git you are also free to email me at evy<dot>kassirer<at>gmail<dot>com
