# edtech-resources
Hi! I love ed tech and other applications of technology to social good.

I also love lists, so I made a [table of over 50 companies in edtech and social good](organizations.md) I've found over the past few years!

I also have a [table of groups, meetups and events](events-and-meetups.md) in education technology.

Please feel free to add more resources! I look forward to seeing your pull request :) -- and if you're unfamiliar with git you [learn it here](https://try.github.io/) or feel free to email me at evy<dot>kassirer<at>gmail<dot>com
